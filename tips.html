        <h1>10 Steps to Healthy, Happy Aging</h1>
        <p>Getting older doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll have a slew of medical conditions or poor quality of life, but it’s important to know what’s normal for your 
            body as you age — and what is not..</p>
            <img src="C:\Users\Dell\OneDrive\Desktop\oldpepple.png" alt="oldpepole">
            <h5>Maintaining friendships and being socially active are important parts of healthy, happy aging.</h5>
            <br>
            <h4>Ideally, you’e been practicing healthy habits throughout your life. But even if you haven’t, 
            it’s never too late to start taking proactive steps to maintain and even improve your 
            health.</h4>
            <h3>1. Stay Physically Active for a Healthy Body and Mind</h3>
            <h4>Exercise can help offset many of the effects of aging. According to Medline Plus,
                exercising regularly can improve your balance, help keep you mobile, improve your
                mood by reducing feelings of anxiety and depression, and contribute to better cognitive functioning.
                It’s also an important part of managing and potentially reducing your risk of
                some diseases, such as diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure, breast and colon 
                cancer, and osteoporosis.
                <br>
                Any exercise at all is better than none for healthy aging, says the Centers for Disease 
                Control and Prevention (CDC), which recommends 150 minutes of moderate-
                intensity aerobic activity (like swimming or taking a brisk walk) each week; you can further break
                 this down into 30 active minutes a day for five days a week. It also recommends 
                twice-weekly muscle-strengthening activities. You can find a list of recommended physical
                 activities here, courtesy of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.</h4>
                 <br>
            <h3>2. Stay Socially Active With Friends and Family and Within Your Community</h3>
            <h4>Making the effort to interact with family and friends can have numerous benefits for your
                     health as you age. One article found that participants (all age 65 and older) who reported
                      higher levels of social activity were more likely to experience more positive moods, fewer 
                      negative feelings, and higher levels of physical activity.

                    If you don’t have an active social life, look for opportunities to reconnect with old friends
                     or make new ones. Seek out like-minded others in church groups, volunteer activities,
                      gyms, alumni groups, or any other group that corresponds to an interest of yours.</h4>
                      <br>
            <h3>3. Follow a Healthy, Well-Balanced Diet</h3>
            <h4>To get the nutrition your body needs for healthy aging and lower your risk of chronic
                     conditions such as heart disease, make whole foods that are high in fiber and low in 
                     saturated fat the foundation of your diet. According to the Harvard T.H. Chan School of
                    Public Health, following an eating plan like the Mediterranean diet can help you to
                    achieve that goal. The Mediterranean diet emphasizes a balance of olive oil, nuts, seeds,
                    fruit and vegetables, whole grains, legumes, and fish. It’s low in red meat, full-fat dairy
                    products, and processed foods.</h4>
                    <br>
            <h3>4. Don’t Neglect Yourself: Schedule Checkups and Stick to Them</h3>
            <h4>Regular checkups with your doctor, dentist, eye doctor, and specialist healthcare
                         providers are opportunities to catch problems early and treat them before they become 
                         bigger problems.

                        If you have one or more chronic medical conditions, take multiple medications, are
                        experiencing memory or mobility issues, or have been recently hospitalized, you may
                        want to schedule an appointment with a geriatrician, notes the American Association 
                        of Retired Persons (AARP). Geriatricians specialize in the care and treatment of people who 
                        are aging. Following an initial consultation, they can refer you to other specialists,
                        coordinate care and treatments for health issues, and help you create a care plan 
                        tailored to your needs.</h4>
                        <br>
            <h3>5. Take All Medication as Directed by Your Doctor</h3>
            <h4>It may seem like a no-brainer, but it bears repeating that you should always take any
                            medication prescribed to you exactly as directed. It’s also worth doing a periodic
                            medication review with your primary care doctor to discuss whether all of your
                            prescriptions are still necessary. The more drugs you take, the harder it can be to
                            remember when and how to take them all, and the higher your risk for negative drug
                            reactions, as well as drug-drug interactions.</h4>
                            <br>
            <h4>While you should almost never stop taking a drug without consulting your doctor first,
                                it can pay to be proactive about reviewing the necessity of all the drugs you’ve been
                                prescribed. And keep in mind that your pharmacist is another resource for information 
                                on drugs, drug side effects, and drug interactions.</h4>
                                <br>
             <h3>6. Limit How Much Alcohol You Drink</h3>
             <h4>The joint 2020–2025 Dietary Guidelines from the U.S. Departments of Agriculture and
                Health and Human Services advise that alcohol drinking be limited to one drink per day 
                for women and two drinks per day for men. It also notes that less drinking overall is
                better for your health. However, a report published by the 2020 Dietary Guidelines
                Advisory Committee advises that men limit their alcohol consumption to one drink per day, too. </h4>
                <br>
             <h4>The advisory committee’s advice is based on studies that show that the mortality risk
                 associated with drinking alcohol is increased at levels above one drink per day
                  on average for both men and women.</h4>       
                  <br>
            <h3>7. Quit Smoking to Lower Your Risk of Cancer and Heart Disease</h3>  
            <h4>If you’re a smoker, you’ll want to quit as a matter of urgency: According to 
                SmokeFree.gov, the health benefits of quitting smoking include lower cholesterol, blood
                pressure, and heart rate; a lower risk of cancer, diabetes, and lung damage; and stronger
                 bones, muscles, and immune system.</h4>  
                 <br>
            <h3>8. Get the Sleep That Your Body Needs</h3>            
            <h4>The Sleep Foundation recommends that those age 65 and older get between seven and 
                eight hours of sleep each night on average, yet individual needs can vary. As you age, you
                may notice that your sleep schedule shifts so that you are sleepier in the early evening
                and ready to wake earlier in the morning. This is not unusual and doesn’t pose an issue
                so long as you continue to meet the recommended seven to eight hours of sleep per
                night. If you are experiencing chronic or acute insomnia, speak with your doctor, who can
                help you determine what’s keeping you awake and advise you on possible solutions.</h4>    
                <br>
            <h3>9. Practice Good Dental Hygiene Every Day</h3>
            <h4>To protect your teeth and gums, the American Dental Association (ADA) advises brushing
                your teeth twice a day with a soft-bristled toothbrush and fluoride-containing toothpaste, 
                flossing daily, and regularly cleaning any dentures you may wear. Not only will your teeth
                and gums be healthier with this routine, but preventing inflammation in your mouth 
                through good dental hygiene can help you manage other chronic inflammatory 
                conditions, such as diabetes and heart disease, according to the American Academy of
                Periodontology.</h4>
                <br>
            <h3>10. Discuss Changes in Sexual Function With Your Doctor</h3>
            <h4>If you are experiencing changes in your libido or sexual function that are having a
                negative impact on your sex life, talk to your doctor about it. The National Institute on 
                Aging notes that help is available in the form of physical aids or medication, as well as
                in communication with your partner and exploring new avenues to physical and emotional
                intimacy. Your doctor may be able to refer you to a sex therapist, who can help you
                define what a satisfying sex life would look like for you and how to get there.</h4>
                <br>
            <h2>Warning Signs You Shouldn’t Ignore</h2>
            <h4>It’s easy to blame a low mood or fatigue on aging, but aging may not be the direct cause
                of these woes. Feeling constantly exhausted or depressed is not normal at any age.
                If you’ve lost the energy or desire to engage in activities you once enjoyed, see your doctor
                for a checkup. You may be depressed or have another medical problem that needs 
                prompt attention.

                What are some other warning signs you shouldn’t ignore? Any of the following could 
                indicate a major health problem and should be checked out by a medical professional:</h4>
                <br>
            <h4>
                * Abrupt weakness or dizziness
                * Shortness of breath
                * Pressure in your chest area
                * Tingling or numbness, especially on just one side of your body
                * Loss of balance or coordination
                * Difficulty speaking or swallowing
                * Excessive sweating
                * Sudden vision loss or blurred vision
                * Marked swelling, even when you don’t have any recent injuries
                * Rapid weight loss
                * Prolonged confusion
                * Wounds that never seem to heal</h4>
